Coffee Shop Menu
	This program made by our S.E.C. group, allows for easier navigation menus for ordering items sold at your shop. Through this program, a customer (hereafter referred to as a “user”) will be able to input their name and choose what kind of item they want to order, thereby going into a respective menu for the item type chosen. As the user themselves will be inputting their desired items, there will be less chances of obtaining errors when creating a receipt for the customer.
Features:
•	Functions for menus for food and drink item types and receipt creation.
•	Organized menus for ease of navigation for the user(s).
•	Input validation if the user enters an incorrect value/ option.
•	All menus allow for the user to finish their order.
•	Total purchase for the user is calculated in the receipt function where total items being purchased is also displayed to the user.

Overview:
Our program allows for easier customer service, as the users will be able to order at their convenience which decreases the chances of the user being given an incorrect order. Their order will also be displayed as they continue to order, in order to show the user what they are ordering as they navigate the menus. The order information, including total price for all items being purchased, will be stored in a separate file once the order is finished for future reference and printing.
This program will first ask the user for their name in order to store it in their receipt after their order is finished, after which it will then take the user to a main hub menu where the user can choose to enter a menu of either food items or drink items. Within these menus, the user will be shown what items are available and will be able to input what they would like to order and the quantity of the selected item. After an order has been placed, the user may wither choose another item, return to the main menu to enter a different menu, or finish ordering to proceed to checkout and print out a receipt for the user.
